# Amazon-Fake-Review-Detection
New vendors on Amazon are utlizing new marketing strategies which assist their products to appear on the top searches using Amazon choice feature, this involves posting multiple ads on different social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook for users. The interested public will click on the ads, and a deal takes place between the seller and the buyer where the buyer must post a 5-star review in return for a free product from Amazon. The importance of reviews is for companies to make design decisions of their product and services. However, these days reviews are misused; for example, 5-star reviews push the product to feature on the first few pages of the Amazon product list and entice other buyers to purchase based on the review. We propose a fake review detection system that detects fake reviews using a combination of vectorization and machine learning models like Support Vector Machine and Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes. For validation, we tested a few fake reviews posted by us on Amazon, resulting in 71% accuracy.
